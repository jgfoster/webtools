WebTools is available at https://github.com/jgfoster/webtools

WebTools has been developed and tested on Chrome (version 22).
WebTools requires the HTML canvas API to draw statmonitor graphics.
This means that it does not work on IE8 or earlier. Other modern broswers
support the canvas API so should work (but has not been tested).
